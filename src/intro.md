# Introduction

Cubing resources are easy to procure, but they often lack the proper annotations to explain the context -- When should I learn this? How much faster will I be? Is X the only way to Y? What sort of progression should I expect? Is this the best quality resource out there? As a result, cubers might get confused about what to learn next, or spent time learning stuff way too advanced for their level.

That's the motivation behind the Roux Reader. It hopes to fill this void for Roux method speedsolvers: by being the missing user manual that explains how to pick the top quality resources that are best suited to your skill level, and how to set expectations when learning them.

Of course, this reader serves as a useful collection of resources, but what makes it uniquely valuable is the writers actually offer opinions to help you pick the right resources and answer all the common FAQs you might have, with the ultimate goal that you can walk away with a much better idea of how to improve your times next.

Even when the right questions do get asked, they are answered times and again, leading to much inefficiency -- if only we can gather all these FAQs in one place and answer them once and for good!
